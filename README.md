# RLGym-Saturn-Rewards
An explanation of the most successful rewards for my RLGym bot, Saturn.

*DISCLAIMER: These rewards are definitely not perfect, and I will continue to improve and refine many of these logical systems. Reward logic explanations are subject to change if I discover better logic.
My judgment of what works and what doesn't is primarily based on my own experience, so what works for me might not work for you. Always experiment, especially with reward weights and threshold values.*
